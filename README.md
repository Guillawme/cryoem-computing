# Some scientific computing stuff

Modulefiles, SLURM submission templates, wrappers and other various scripts
I use for cryo-EM computing.

**These files contain custom configuration (especially paths) that will prevent
them from working on any system. Adjust to your system's specificities if you
want to use them.**
